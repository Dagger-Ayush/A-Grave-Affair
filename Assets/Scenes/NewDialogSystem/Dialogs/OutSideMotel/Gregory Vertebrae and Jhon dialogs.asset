  - Is that you, Greg???
  - Johny!? What are you doing so far out of town? I thought you decided to take
    an exile in your apartment.
  - Yeah, I decided to go out for a stroll. Jessica would have given me an earful
    if I started to become a couch potato
  - " I\u2019m sorry to hear about your wife, but this is considerably far for a
    stroll, you practicing for a walkathon or something?"
  - " I got an anonymous letter calling me here to solve a mystery. At first, I thought
    someone was pranking me, but seeing that you are here, I don\u2019t think it
    was a prank."
  - Apparently, there was an accidental death at the Bloomingdale motel, so I had
    been sent to figure out the mess.
  - THE ACCIDENTAL DEATH! That has to be the one!
  - "ohny\u2026. I can\u2019t let you interfere with police business. I\u2019ll get
    chewed out by my superiors if they find out."
  - "Come on, Greg, I know something is up here, and I can prove it. Please, for
    old times' sake\u2026"
  - "Okay okay don\u2019t get all mushy on me, but only because something might actually
    be wrong, and I\u2019ll be the one making the arrest."
  - "Okay okay don\u2019t get all mushy on me, but only because something might actually
    be wrong, and I\u2019ll be the one making the arrest."
  - "You got yourself a deal, now let\u2019s go!"
