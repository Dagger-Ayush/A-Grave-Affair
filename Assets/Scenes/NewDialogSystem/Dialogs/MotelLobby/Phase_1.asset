  - "The atmosphere is tense as a pair of strangers gather around a young woman\u2019s
    body, the circumstances of her death unclear."
  - Oh my God! This is horrible, such an innocent life taken far too early.
  - "You didn\u2019t even know her that well\u2026. "
  - "Shut up. It\u2019s a tragedy nonetheless; no one deserves to fall down the stairs
    and die. "
  - "I had seen it in movies, but I had never seen it in real life. Can anyone actually
    even die from falling down the stairs\u2026"
