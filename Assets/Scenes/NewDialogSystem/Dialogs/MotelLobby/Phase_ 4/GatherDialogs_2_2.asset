  - Oh my god! I also had one of those milkshakes. Am I going to die???
  - "But\u2026I didn\u2019t \u2026.. Milkshakes are my passion; I would never poison
    them"
  - Are you certain, Detective? Alex has maintained a spotless record since she arrived.
  - "If John says it\u2019s murder, I believe him. He\u2019s got an eye for detail
    sharper than anyone I\u2019ve worked with."
  - The detective is always right. Arrest her before she poisons the other guests!
  - "I swear I didn\u2019t do it! You have to believe me !!"
  - "t\u2019s not looking good for you, Alex. You are the only one who delivered
    milkshakes to the guests, and Martin had an Alibi as he was with Ms. Regina."
  - "But it\u2019s also true that there\u2019s no motive for her to do this, so until
    I investigate further, Gregory will have to keep an eye on her and everyone else."
  - Oh, great, just when I thought all this was over.
  - "I\u2019m not ready to go to jail\u2026 I haven\u2019t even gotten my career
    out of this dump.  "
  - WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!!!
  - "Calm down, you idiot! Detective, there has to be some misunderstanding. Please
    get to the bottom of this! Our Motel\u2019s spotless record can\u2019t be tainted
    because of this."
