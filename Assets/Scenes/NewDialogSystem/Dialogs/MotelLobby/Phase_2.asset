  - "Hey y\u2019all, we received a call about an accidental death. I\u2019m Detective
    John Marrow. "
  - This is my colleague Gregory Vertebrae. We had a few questions before we conducted
    the investigation.
  - "I\u2019m Martin Femur, the manager of this motel. I\u2019m the one who made
    the call. The lady you can see lying on the floor was a guest named Nancy Cranium.  "
  - I had gone out to the back for a smoke break and found her lying in a pool of
    blood at the base of the stairs.
  - "Ahh.. right, the call. Well, no need to worry, now that we are here, we\u2019ll
    get to the bottom of this"
